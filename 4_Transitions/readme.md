# CSS Animation and Keyframes

This example demonstrates the use of CSS animations and keyframes to create dynamic visual effects on web elements. This README will provide a clear explanation of the animation code and introduce the animation shorthand property, along with details about animation properties.

## Description

In the provided HTML and CSS code, we have a simple webpage with a `<div>` element.

### HTML Structure

- The HTML contains a `<div>` element with the class "box," which displays the text "Animation."

### CSS Animation

The CSS code defines an animation for the "box" element. Let's break down the key properties and concepts related to this animation:

#### Animation Shorthand Property

The animation is defined using the shorthand property `animation` in the `.box` class. This property combines several animation-related properties into one declaration, making it a convenient way to define animations.

- **`animation-name`**: Specifies the name of the keyframes animation, which is defined as `anime` in this example.

- **`animation-duration`**: Sets the duration of the animation in seconds (1s in this case).

- **`animation-delay`**: Sets the delay before the animation starts (0s in this case).

- **`animation-iteration-count`**: Determines how many times the animation should run (5 times in this case).

- **`animation-timing-function`**: Defines the timing function for the animation (ease-in in this case).

#### Keyframes Animation

The `@keyframes` rule defines a sequence of keyframes that specify how the "box" element should change over time. In this example:

- `0%`: The animation starts with a border-radius of 0% and a red background color.

- `25%`: At 25% of the animation duration, the border-radius increases to 25%, and the background color changes to orange.

- `50%`: At the halfway point, the border-radius becomes 50%, and the background color changes to yellow.

- `100%`: Finally, at 100% of the animation, the border-radius reaches 100%, and the background color turns green.

## Resources to Learn CSS Animations

If you're interested in learning more about CSS animations, there are several resources available:

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the HTML and CSS files.

2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

3. Observe the "box" element with the defined animation properties. It will display a dynamic animation with changing border-radius and background color.

4. Review the CSS code to understand how the animation is defined, paying special attention to the shorthand `animation` property.

## Conclusion

CSS animations and keyframes allow you to add dynamic and engaging visual effects to your web projects. Understanding animation properties and keyframes is essential for creating interactive and visually appealing websites.
