## What is Flexbox?

Flexbox, short for Flexible Box Layout, is a CSS layout model designed for creating efficient and predictable layouts in web design. It provides an easier way to distribute space and align content within a container, even when the container's size is unknown or dynamic. Flexbox is particularly useful for building responsive and complex layouts with minimal code.

## Basic Flexbox Properties

Here are some fundamental Flexbox properties you'll use frequently:

- `display: flex;`: Applied to a container, it turns its children into flex items, allowing you to control their layout.

- `flex-direction`: Specifies the direction in which flex items are laid out. Common values include `row`, `column`, `row-reverse`, and `column-reverse`.

- `justify-content`: Determines how flex items are distributed along the main axis (horizontal for `row` and `row-reverse`, vertical for `column` and `column-reverse`). Options include `flex-start`, `center`, `flex-end`, `space-between`, and more.

- `align-items`: Controls the alignment of flex items along the cross axis (vertical for `row` and `row-reverse`, horizontal for `column` and `column-reverse`). Options include `flex-start`, `center`, `flex-end`, and others.

- `flex`: Specifies how flex items grow or shrink to fill available space. It consists of three values: `flex-grow`, `flex-shrink`, and `flex-basis`.

- `align-self`: Overrides the `align-items` property for individual flex items, allowing you to control their alignment independently.
