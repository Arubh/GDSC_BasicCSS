# Gradient and Shadow Tutorial

In this tutorial, we will explore CSS properties for creating gradients and applying shadows to elements. We will learn how to use linear, radial, and conic gradients to style elements, as well as apply text and box shadows for visual effects. This README.md will provide explanations for each property and its related concepts used in the code.

## Overview

CSS gradients allow you to create smooth color transitions for backgrounds, while shadows can be applied to text and elements to add depth and visual appeal to your web page.

## HTML Structure

The HTML document (`index.html`) contains two sections: one for gradient backgrounds and another for text and box shadows. Each section includes `div` elements with unique identifiers used for styling.

## Gradient Backgrounds

### Linear Gradient

- `background-image: linear-gradient(red, yellow, green);`: This style creates a linear gradient background with a transition from red to yellow to green. You can customize the colors to achieve different effects.

### Radial Gradient

- `background-image: radial-gradient(red, yellow, green);`: This style creates a radial gradient background with a similar color transition. Experiment with colors to see the changes.

### Conic Gradient

- `background-image: conic-gradient(red, yellow, green);`: This style creates a conic gradient background with a rotation of colors around a central point.

## Text and Box Shadows

### Text Shadow

- `text-shadow: 3px 3px red;`: This property applies a shadow to the text within the element. In our example, we have added a red shadow with a horizontal and vertical offset of 3 pixels.

### Box Shadow

- `box-shadow: 10px 10px 8px black;`: This property applies a shadow to the entire box. It includes parameters for horizontal and vertical offsets, blur radius, and shadow color. In this case, we have a black shadow with specific offsets and blur.

## Styles Applied

The CSS styles applied to the elements include gradient backgrounds, shadow effects on text and boxes, font choices, and padding. These styles are used to enhance the appearance of the HTML elements within the document.
