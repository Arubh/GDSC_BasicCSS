# CSS Animation and Keyframes

This example demonstrates the use of CSS animations and keyframes to create dynamic visual effects on web elements.

## Description

In the provided HTML and CSS code, we have a simple webpage with a `<div>` element.

### CSS Animation

The CSS code defines an animation for the "box" element. Let's break down the key properties:

- **Animation Name**: `animation-name` specifies the name of the keyframes animation, which is defined as `anime`.

- **Animation Duration**: `animation-duration` sets the duration of the animation (1 second in this case).

- **Animation Delay**: `animation-delay` sets the delay before the animation starts (no delay in this case).

- **Animation Iteration Count**: `animation-iteration-count` determines how many times the animation should run (5 times in this case).

- **Animation Timing Function**: `animation-timing-function` defines the timing function for the animation (ease-in for a smooth start).

### Keyframes Animation

The `@keyframes` rule defines how the "box" element changes over time:

- `0%`: The animation starts with a square shape (border-radius: 0%) and a red background.

- `25%`: At 25% of the animation, the border-radius increases to create rounded corners, and the background becomes orange.

- `50%`: At the halfway point, the border-radius increases further, making a circle, and the background becomes yellow.

- `100%`: Finally, at 100%, the border-radius reaches its maximum (100%), creating a full circle, and the background turns green.

## Resources to Learn CSS Animations

If you want to explore CSS animations further, consider these resources:

## Usage

1. Clone this repository or download the HTML and CSS files.

2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

3. Observe the "box" element with the animation. It will display a dynamic animation with changing shape and colors.

4. Review the CSS code to understand how the animation is defined.

## Conclusion

CSS animations and keyframes add interactivity and visual appeal to web elements. Understanding animation properties and keyframes is essential for creating engaging and visually appealing websites.
