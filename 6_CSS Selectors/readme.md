# HTML and CSS Selectors Practice

This repository contains a simple HTML document with various CSS selectors for practice. The HTML file (`index.html`) includes different types of HTML elements, and the associated CSS file (`tut.css`) demonstrates how to apply styles using various selectors. This README.md provides an overview of the code and suggests ways to practice and experiment with it.

## HTML Structure

The HTML document (`index.html`) includes the following elements:

- `<div id="idSelector">`: An HTML element selected by ID.
- `<div class="classSelector">`: An HTML element selected by class.
- `<div class="combinatorSelectors">`: A container div with child divs and nested divs for practicing combinator selectors.

## CSS Selectors

The `tut.css` file demonstrates the following CSS selectors and styles:

- Universal Selector (`*`): Sets a background color and font family for all elements.
- ID Selector (`#idSelector`): Styles the element with the ID "idSelector" with a unique background color and font family.
- Class Selector (`.classSelector`): Styles elements with the class "classSelector" with a background color and font family.
- Descendant Selector (`.child-1 div`): Styles the `div` elements within the element with the class "child-1" within the ".combinatorSelectors" container.

## Practical Exercises

You can practice and experiment with this code by:

1. **Commenting/Uncommenting Styles**: In the `tut.css` file, try commenting out or uncommenting different style properties to see how they affect the appearance of the HTML elements. This will help you understand the impact of different CSS rules.

2. **Creating New Selectors**: Add your own CSS selectors to target specific elements in the HTML document. Try selecting elements using different criteria such as element type, IDs, classes, or combinator selectors.

3. **Modifying HTML Content**: Change the content of the HTML elements in the `index.html` file to see how CSS styles apply to different text and elements.

4. **Exploring Combinator Selectors**: Experiment with different combinator selectors (`~`, `>`, ` `, `+`) by modifying the `.child-1 div` selector in the `tut.css` file. Observe how these selectors affect the styling of specific elements.
