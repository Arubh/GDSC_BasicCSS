## Overview

The CSS `background` property is a versatile property used to style the background of an HTML element. It can be applied to various elements like `div`, making it useful for designing visually appealing web pages.

## HTML Structure

The HTML document (`index.html`) contains two sections: one for background colors and another for background images. Each section contains multiple `div` elements with unique identifiers that we will use for styling.

## CSS Background Property

### background-color

- `background-color`: This property is used to set the background color of an element. In this example, we have used it to define background colors for three different `div` elements with IDs `bg1`, `bg2`, and `bg3`. These colors are represented in various formats, including HEX, RGB, and RGBA.

### background-image

- `background-image`: This property allows you to set a background image for an element. In our example, we have applied it to a `div` element with the ID `bgimg1`. The image is loaded from an external source using the `url()` function.

## Color Representations

### HEX Color

- HEX color is represented using a pound sign (`#`) followed by a combination of six hexadecimal digits. For example, `#b6d7f3` is a HEX color used as a background color in our example. It provides a wide range of color options.

### RGB Color

- RGB color is represented using the `rgb()` function, followed by three values (red, green, and blue) separated by commas. Each value ranges from 0 to 255. For example, `rgb(100, 237, 130)` is an RGB color used as a background color.

### RGBA Color With Opacity

- RGBA color is an extension of RGB and is represented using the `rgba()` function. It includes an additional value for opacity, ranging from 0 (fully transparent) to 1 (fully opaque). In our example, `rgba(195, 231, 254, 0.5)` sets a background color with a 50% opacity level.

## Styles Applied

The CSS styles applied to the elements include background colors and images. These styles enhance the visual presentation of the HTML document. You can experiment with different color representations and images to customize your web page's appearance.
