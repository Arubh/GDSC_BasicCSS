# HTML and CSS Styling Example

This repository provides a simple HTML document (`index.html`) and an associated CSS file (`tut.css`) to demonstrate basic HTML and CSS styling. In this README.md, we will outline the purpose of the code, its structure, and how to experiment with it.

## Overview

The code in this repository showcases HTML elements styled using CSS. It features two text elements within a container, and the associated styles include font properties, background colors, and more. This example is intended to help you understand how to apply basic styling to HTML elements.

## HTML Structure

The HTML document (`index.html`) contains the following structure:

- `<div class="texts">`: A container div that holds two text elements.
  - `<div class="text1">`: The first example text element.
  - `<div class="text2">`: The second example text element.

## CSS Styling

The `tut.css` file demonstrates various CSS styling properties applied to the HTML elements. Key styling properties include:

- Universal Selector (`*`): Sets a black background color for all elements on the page.

- `@import` Rule: Imports the Google Fonts library, specifically the "Poppins" font with different weights.

- `.text1, .text2` Selector: Styles both `.text1` and `.text2` elements with various font properties, color, and text alignment. Some properties are commented out; you can experiment with them by uncommenting and modifying their values.

- `body` Selector: Styles the entire body of the HTML document, setting properties like font size, font family, and centering the content.

- `.text1, .text2` Selector (Again): Sets a margin and width for both `.text1` and `.text2` elements.

## Practical Exercises

To practice and experiment with this code, consider the following exercises:

1. **Commenting/Uncommenting Styles**: In the `tut.css` file, try commenting out or uncommenting different style properties to observe how they affect the appearance of the HTML elements. This will help you understand the impact of CSS rules.

2. **Changing Font Styles**: Modify the font properties (e.g., `font-family`, `font-weight`, `font-size`) in the `.text1, .text2` selector to explore different font styles.

3. **Color Experimentation**: Experiment with different color values for the `color` property in the `.text1, .text2` selector. You can use color names, hexadecimal values, or RGB values.

4. **Background Color**: Change the background color set by the universal selector (`*`) to a different color and observe its impact on the page.
