# CSS Display Property Example

This is a simple example demonstrating the use of the CSS `display` property to control the layout of HTML elements.

## Description

In this example, we have a basic HTML structure with a set of `<div>` elements inside the `<body>`. Each `<div>` element has a class of "box," and we use CSS to style these elements.


### CSS Display Property

The CSS `display` property is used to control how elements are displayed on a web page. In this example, we have included several options for the `display` property as comments within the CSS code. You can uncomment one of these options at a time to see how it affects the layout of the "box" elements. Here are the available options:

- `display: block;`: This makes each "box" element behave as a block-level element, stacking them vertically.

- `display: inline;`: This makes each "box" element behave as an inline-level element, causing them to appear next to each other horizontally.

- `display: inline-block;`: This combines the characteristics of both block and inline elements, allowing the "box" elements to appear next to each other while maintaining their block-level styling.

- `display: none;`: This hides the "box" elements from the page entirely.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the HTML and CSS files.

2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

3. Uncomment one of the `display` property options in the CSS code to see how it affects the layout of the "box" elements.

4. Experiment with different `display` property values to learn more about their behavior.
