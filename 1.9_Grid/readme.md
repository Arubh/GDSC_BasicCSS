## Overview

CSS Grid is a powerful layout system that allows you to create complex webpage layouts with ease. It's particularly useful for creating responsive designs with rows and columns. In this tutorial, we'll create a simple webpage layout to understand the basic concepts of CSS Grid.

## HTML Structure

The HTML document (`index.html`) contains a `grid-container` div with five child divs (`item1` to `item5`). Each child div represents a section of the webpage, such as header, author, content, sidebar, and footer.

## CSS Grid Properties

### Grid Container

- `.grid-container`: This class styles the container element and applies grid layout properties to it.

### Grid Items

- `.item1`, `.item2`, `.item3`, `.item4`, `.item5`: These classes assign grid areas to each child div within the container. The `grid-area` property specifies where each div should appear in the grid layout.

## Grid Layout

### Grid Areas

- `grid-template-areas`: This property defines the layout of the grid by assigning names to grid areas. In this example, we have named the areas 'header,' 'ads,' 'main,' 'sidebar,' and 'footer.'

### Grid Template Columns and Rows

- `grid-template-columns` and `grid-template-rows`: These properties define the number and size of columns and rows in the grid. In our example, we have specified three columns of 150px, auto (which adjusts to available space), and 150px width, and three rows of 70px, 150px, and 70px height.

### Grid Gap

- `grid-gap`: This property sets the spacing between grid items. In our case, there is a 10px gap between items.

## Styles Applied

The CSS styles applied to the grid container and its child divs include background colors, text alignment, padding, and font size. These styles enhance the appearance of the webpage layout.
