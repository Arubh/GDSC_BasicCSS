# Responsive Design with Media Queries

In this repository, you'll find a simple HTML document (`index.html`) and an associated CSS file (`tut.css`) that demonstrates responsive design using media queries. This README.md will explain the purpose of the code, its structure, and how media queries are used to create a responsive design.

## Overview

Responsive design is an essential aspect of modern web development. It ensures that web pages adapt and look good on various devices and screen sizes, from large desktop monitors to small mobile screens. Media queries are a crucial tool in achieving responsive design, as they allow you to apply different styles based on the user's device or screen width.

## HTML Structure

The HTML document (`index.html`) contains a single `<div>` element with the class "box." This is the element that will be styled and modified using media queries for responsive design.

## Responsive Design with Media Queries

In the `tut.css` file, media queries are used to change the background color of the `.box` element based on the screen width. Here's how it works:

- `@media (min-width: 768px)`: This media query targets screens with a minimum width of 768 pixels. When the screen width is 768 pixels or wider, it sets the background color of the `.box` element to a specific shade of red (`rgb(131, 2, 2)`).

- `@media (max-width: 768px)`: This media query targets screens with a maximum width of 768 pixels. When the screen width is 768 pixels or narrower (i.e., on smaller screens like mobile devices), it sets the background color of the `.box` element to a different shade of purple (`rgb(82, 7, 151)`).

## Media Queries Explained

**Media queries** are CSS rules that allow you to apply different styles to your web page based on the characteristics of the user's device or viewport. They are a key component of responsive web design, enabling you to create layouts and styles that adapt to different screen sizes, resolutions, and device capabilities.

Here's a breakdown of the media queries used in this example:

- `@media (min-width: 768px)`: This media query applies styles when the minimum width of the viewport is 768 pixels or wider. It's commonly used for larger screens like tablets and desktops. In this example, it sets a red background color for the `.box` element.

- `@media (max-width: 768px)`: This media query applies styles when the maximum width of the viewport is 768 pixels or narrower. It's often used for smaller screens like mobile devices. In this example, it sets a purple background color for the `.box` element.

Media queries help you create a fluid and responsive design by adjusting your styles to fit different screen sizes and orientations, enhancing the user experience across various devices.
